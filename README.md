This repository contains the complete, reproducible pipeline for training an Explainable AI–based liver fibrosis staging model using both Ultrasound (US) and MRI modalities.
Both modalities follow the same training pipeline, same preprocessing logic, and same explainability workflow (Layer-CAM) for a unified framework.
